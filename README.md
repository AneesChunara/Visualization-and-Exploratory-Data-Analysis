The first challenge relates to Subway Hourly Ridership: https://data.ny.gov/Transportation/MTA-Subway-Hourly-Ridership-Beginning-February-202/wujg-7c2s/about_data 

Make a scatterplot that has one point for each subway station in NYC using latitude and longitude to plot the points. Each point should be colored on a spectrum (eg red to green) that reflects the average number of riders per hour at that station. 

Bonus: Make an animation that colors the points based on hourly ridership over time. In your animation include some text that shows the time of day. The time period over which the animation takes place is up to you. If you do this, please try to save your video as a file, post it on a cloud video service (eg youtube) and provide a link to the video.

Second challenge:  Link the crime data (specifically turnstype jumping) to the subway data. We started doing this in class as a lab exercise. The new dataset should enrich the "arrests" dataset such that a new column (the name of the closest subway station) is incorporated. Also only rows pertaining to turnstyle jumping should be included in the new dataset. Please export your resulting dataframe to a csv.
